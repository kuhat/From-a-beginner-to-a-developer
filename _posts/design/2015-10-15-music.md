## Music Pieces

### »Voyage of Dream«

+ Youtube music [Link](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=poRYCzeMkZc&feature=share).

Sailing in the night sky, hoping to see the sunrise, enduring the hardships, the down is yet to come. Let the stars lead the way, the beacons shining in the dark, grab the hope, and continue to glide, the horizon is calling ahead.

Combining Funk and Pop, ***Voyage of Dream*** charts the journey from disorientation to finding yourself in a jumpy shuffle beat.

Voyage of dream
 
Producer: Danny
Lyrics by: Danny
Composed by: Danny
Mixed by: Danny
Mastered by: Danny
 
In the dark of night
The stars are only spot
Lost in dreams and lost in time
A voyage without rhyme
 
Gazing up to sky
I seek the truth to thrive
Every spark makes dream take flight
Seizing to dim light
 
In the ship of dream I sail
When the hopes are high and never frail
With the compass of the heart
My hopes and fears side by side
Through the storm, through the rapid tide, 
through the rough through the tough with the stars as my guide
As I follow life's flow
I will carry on to see the down
 
Sometimes I lose the way
Suffer from my dismay
A thousand dream that fade in time
Lost in the endless night
 
Whisper to the wind
Hope to find a clue
Lost at sea no land in sight
In the abyss of despair
 
In the ship of dream I sail
Lost direction but with steady mind
A beacon in the dark it shines
Promising a brand new day will come
Through the silence through the cold 
through the fear through the old with the stars as my guide
listening to the song of star
In the melody
Where the map belongs
 
In the ship of dream I glide
With the sunrise as my final pride
The course is clear the horizon's here
Sailing into the place where dream resides
Through the down through the gloominess 
through the joy through the cheer with star as my guide
sunrise comes after the night
heading into the future
where the dream resides
 
In the ship of dream I sail
Lost direction but with steady mind
A beacon in the dark it shines
Promising a brand new day will come
Through the silence through the cold 
through the fear through the old with the stars as my guide
listening to the song of star
In the melody
Where the map belong

The storm the tide
 will never stop my try
The silence the fear
 will never be the barrier
The stars they shine
Brighten the lonesome night
The destination is in sight I head toward the future
 
The truth the dream
Will lead my way ahead
The beacons they glint
Show the way to the sunrise
Horizon is calling
Breaking the endless night
The voyage hasn't over yet
Try to let passion fly, sailing into the sun
 
The storm the tide, will never stop my try 
(In the ship of dreams I glide)
The silence the fear, will never be the barrier 
(With the sunrise as my final pride)
The stars they shine, brighten the lonesome night 
(The course is clear the horizon's here)
The destination is in sight, I head toward the future 
(Sailing into the place where dream resides)
The truth the dream, will lead my way ahead 
(Through the down through the gloominess)
The beacons they glint, show the way to the sunrise 
(Through the joy through the cheer with star as my guide)
Horizon is calling, breaking the endless night 
(Sunrise comes after the night)
The voyage hasn't over yet, try to let passion fly, sailing into the sun 
(heading into the future, where the dream resides)

### »Still Wait«

+ Youtube Music [Link](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=T0WtZm0vYoE&feature=share).

The song ***Still Wait*** was created against the backdrop of the `Covid-19` pandemic. In 2022, the third year of the pandemic, lovers and friends can't get together and can only communicate online through the Internet. While this may ease our desire to see each other, it does not substantially solve the problem. We can only keep the vision of meeting, believe that we will meet again in the near future. 

It is my great honor to invite *Shahab Ahmed* from Pakistan as the co-lyricist of this song, to work with me on the production of this song. He has experienced the epidemic more than any other person, and he has deep feelings about it. Two consecutive years of separation until graduation, the end of the epidemic is far from in sight... When will we see each other again?

Still Wait

Lyrics by: Shahab Ahmed/Danny hao
Composed by: Danny hao
Arranged by: Danny hao
Produced by: Danny hao/Shahab Ahmed

I know you can feel that something
that is hurting inside your emotion
The reminders of when we used to meet
still talking about different things

Those were the simpler times
but now we are thousand miles away
sometimes it’s getting hard
How long would you be in this pain

The two of us seem sad
the sorrow of yearning
when we'll see each other once more
when will that come to pass

We can reason as one
But we can't be together
It isn't equal to emotion 
Cuz this doesn't feel real
still wait

The longing has affected us
But the world just keep separating us
Somewhere, we are waiting outside there
We are hoping our dream comes true

Memories still shines
But the bridge is broken down we can’t
Go back to good old days
How long would you be in this pain

The two of us seem sad
the sorrow of yearning
When we’ll see each other once more
When will that come to pass

We can reason as one
But we can't be together
It isn't equal to emotion
Cuz this doesn't feel real
Still waiting

All right, we should let it go
All the time, don't you worry
Our paths will keep crossing once more
 Someday

The two of us seem sad
The sorrow of yearning
Isolation take control of us
When shall we meet again

We can reason as one
But we can't be together
It isn't equal to emotion 
Cuz this doesn't feel real

Although we both seem sad
the sorrow of yearning
We will see each other once again
Just in the near future

We can reason as one
But we can't be together
No matter how long this would proceed
Just in the near future
Still wait
```

## »执剑说«
This is a Chinese song which depicts an ancient swordsman who seeks truth and meaning of life through hardships and adventures. He left home at a young age with the ambition to go anywhere with a sword and have a strong sense of justice and ready to help the weak. However, after dealing with normal people he found that the heart of human kind is actually selfish. After getting hurt and thriving from dirty tricks with bureaucrats and rivals, he decided to throw away the burden and face the endeavors himself.

执剑说

作词: Danny周闻浩
作曲: Danny周闻浩
编曲/混音: Danny周闻浩

江湖
情仇酒一壶
尘路
以天地为庐
回首
叹半生孤独
翘盼
看前路无助

萧萧月光凄寒
剑光冷煞
斩破泪与茶
纵然桃花落下
梦飘向天涯

绝笔纸上天下
浪迹天涯
故国千里画
归来蜕变仰望
只剩下彷徨

尘世如潮 难做逍遥
不谙虞与诈
古道残垣 枯树昏鸦
断肠走天涯
江湖煮酒 难辨真假
比不过清茶
奈何真真假假
不如寻常人家
天涯消逝了牵挂

故国
含笑自漂泊
灯火
人世尽蹉跎
携剑
千里争雄霸
策马
抛却了牵挂

漫漫长歌婉转
剑气凛然
饮尽了沧桑
携星茫醉一场
笑把红尘忘

大鹏扶摇直上
簸却沧溟
未可轻年少
从此豪杰可当
轻狂又何妨

尘世如潮 难做逍遥
不谙虞与诈
古道残垣 枯树昏鸦
断肠走天涯
江湖煮酒 难辨真假
比不过清茶
奈何真真假假
不如寻常人家
天涯消逝了牵挂

尘世如潮 醉时逍遥
管他虞与诈
鲜衣怒马 无甚牵挂
不负此年华
江湖煮酒 无谓真假
清醒时自折花
管他真真假假
我只纵横天下
执剑说拭血论茶

尘世如潮 醉时逍遥
管他虞与诈
鲜衣怒马 无甚牵挂
不负此年华
江湖煮酒 无谓真假
清醒时自折花
管他真真假假
我只纵横天下
执剑说拭血论茶
```
